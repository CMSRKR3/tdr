% >> Abstract Abstract processing: 1. **DO NOT use \include or
% \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not
% search through other files than this one.  2. **DO NOT
% use %** to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will
% still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. For PASs: **DO NOT use CMS tex macros.**...in the abstract: CDS
% MathJax processor used on the abstract doesn't understand them _and_
% will only look within $$. The abstracts for papers are hand
% formatted so macros are okay.
\abstract{}

% >> PDF Metadata Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines
% (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by
% CDS.  Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are
% sensible and are in plain text with the possible exception of the
% PDFtitle for a PAS. Then you can use pure TeX symbols as if on a
% typewriter. Examples: $\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$ => $sqrt{s}=$ 13 TeV;
% 32\fbinv => 32 fb$^{-1}$ No unescaped comment % characters.
% No curly braces {} except for TeX in the PDFtitle.
