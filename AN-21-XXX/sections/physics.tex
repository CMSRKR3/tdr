\fixme{Describe the preliminary analysis of 2022 data set to estimate
  the number of BKee candidates at low q2.}

\subsection{Estimating \texorpdfstring{\bkee}{BToKee} yields at low \texorpdfstring{\qsq}{q2}}
\label{sec:estimates}

The projections for number of expected candidates at low \qsq. As
determined in Ref.~\cite{AN-21-160}. We need to extract signal counts
on J/psi peak and extrapolate to low q2 using MC.

An estimate of the number of candidates recorded at low \qsq using
early data. The latter task will permit a crosscheck of the per-path
signal \axe estimates provided by the di-electron trigger
proposal~\cite{AN-21-160}, which in turn will help to solidify the
end-of-year estimates provided therein.

\subsection{Validating performance with data}
\label{sec:yields}

Unblind a small fraction (\eg 10\%) of the anticipated data set, count
the number of \bkee candidates (should be a few tens) \qsq, and check
the combinatorial background and resulting signal-to-background
ratio.
